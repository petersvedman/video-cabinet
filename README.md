# video-cabinet
Repo for a Raspberry Pi-based video playing cabinet

A Python script for my videocabinet project. The cabinet is 600 mm high, 400 wide and has five GPIO-connected buttons. The buttons start a video playing on the built-in screen. The cabinet code is based on something I found on Hackster.IO, https://www.hackster.io/ThothLoki/play-video-with-python-and-gpio-a30c7a

and then modified by me to suit my project. 

DrawingXX.jpg are scans of the cabinets construction drawings <not done yet>
CabinetXX.jpg are images of the finished cabinet  <not done yet>

all python files are relevant code for the project.
