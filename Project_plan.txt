This is the project plan for my Video Cabinet.

Done so far:

1. Created a GitHub repository, https://github.com/petersvedman/video-cabinet
2. Uploaded videoplay.py script, licensing details and general info to the repository

Still to do:
1. Finish drawings for the cabinet, scan and upload
2. Create drawings for the button interface board and upload them
3. Build prototype interface board
4. Configure the Raspberry Pi
5. Build cabinet, mount hardware
6. Test everything
7. No profit!
